// ANONYMOUS FUNCTION

/*   An anonymous function is simply a function that does not have a name. Unlike named functions, which are declared with a name for easy reference,
 anonymous functions are usually created for specific tasks and are often assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions. 
 
 In JavaScript, you normally use the function keyword followed by a name to declare a function. However, in an anonymous function,
  the name is omitted. These functions are often used in situations where you donâ€™t need to reuse the function outside its immediate context.

 Note: You'll get a syntax error if you don't use parentheses ().
  The parentheses are needed to treat the anonymous function as an expression, which returns a function object.

  const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello, Rinshad!");
