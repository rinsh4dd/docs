/* JavaScript Scope is the area where a variable (or function) exists and is accessible. 
We can layer the scope in a system which means the child scope can access the parent scope but not vice-versa.

Javascript has different scopes

Global Scope
Function Scope
Block Scope
Lexical Scope
Global Variables in HTML
Lifetime of JavaScript Variables */
